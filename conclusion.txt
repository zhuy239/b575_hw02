1.  What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
I think the most challenging part is obeying the syntax of psudocode, especially when you've already had some experience of writing "real" code by python and so on.

2.What is one element earn about git and GitHub through this experience?
I've learned how and why to fork a repository to my own GitHub account. By doing so, individuals can make changes and test them independently without affecting the original project. Once they are done, they can create a pull request to suggest these changes to it.
